## Ingredients
 
### For the base: 

- 100g butter, melted 
- 250g digestive biscuits, crushed 

### For the caramel: 

- 100g butter 
- 100g dark brown soft sugar 
- 397g can Carnation Condensed Milk 

### For the top: 

- 4 small bananas 
- 300ml carton whipping cream, lightly whipped 
- grated chocolate 

## STEPS  

1. Tip the biscuit crumbs into a bowl. Add the butter and mix in. Spoon the crumbs into the base and about halfway up the sides of the tin to make a pie shell. Chill for 10 minutes. 
2. Melt the butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve. 
3. Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with the grated chocolate. 
     

Make sure that you really boil the filling for at least 1 minute to be sure it sets to a perfect squidgy caramel.
