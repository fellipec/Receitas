Yield: 1 to 2 servings 

Time: 30 minutes 

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  
- 1 small red onion or large shallot, chopped 
- 1 garlic clove, minced 
- Salt and black pepper 
- 4 ounces fresh mushrooms, preferably a mixture, trimmed and roughly chopped 
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary or ½ teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary 
- 1 large ciabatta sandwich roll, split horizontally 
- 3 ounces taleggio cheese, thinly sliced 

1. Heat the oven (or a toaster oven) to 450°F. Put the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it’s hot, add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and rosemary and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until all the mushrooms’ liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. 

2. Spread the mushroom mixture evenly over the two halves of the ciabatta roll, top with the taleggio, and transfer to a baking sheet. Bake until the taleggio is melted and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
