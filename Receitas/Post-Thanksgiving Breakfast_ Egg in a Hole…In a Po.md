# Post-Thanksgiving Breakfast: Egg in a Hole…In a Pork Loin 


![GetImage.jpeg](../resources/GetImage.jpeg)


When we last encountered Smithfield Mesquite Marinated Fresh Pork Loin Filet, I was wrapping it in bacon for some extra-good pork-on-pork action. Fortunately, the good folks at Smithfield must have thought this was such a good idea that they now have a fresh pork loin product that comes with the (real) bacon already mixed in. Thank. You. 

Even though I love me some bacon mixed in with dinners and desserts, it’s still hard to deny that it goes best with its longtime life partner, the Bert to its Ernie. I’m talking about eggs of course. I love everything about egg in a hole breakfasts — the cute appearance, the way the whites stick together in a small space and get nice and rich, and especially how the little yolky hole makes such a good spot for ripping off bread and dipping. In thinking about how to use this pork loin for a hearty holiday season breakfast I settled on recreating eggs in a hole…inside a pork loin. Here’s how it went down… 

Bacon and Eggs in a Pork Loin 

– Preheat oven to 375 degrees 
– Take one Smithfield Applewood Smoked Bacon and, with a sharp knife, cut out three small circular holes, about one 3/4-inch into the loin. 
– Optional: Slice the pork loin in half, lengthwise, making sure to cut below your egg holes, and not cutting quite all the way through. Add four strips of Smithfield Hometown Original Bacon into this pocket you’ve created, then fold the top half of the loin back down over your bacon. Because you can’t have too much bacon. 
– Place the pork loin (and the three bits of pork you cut out) on a baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. 
– Take the pork loin out of the oven and crack an egg into each of the three holes. 
– Bake for 15 more minutes.

There you have it. Egg in a hole in a bacon-spiked pork loin. It’s a rich and gooey lazy-morning breakfast, and the little bits of bacon cooked on the bottom are perfect for dipping into the yolk goodness. I served it with some cranberry sauce-spread toast to keep things seasonal. If you’re making this post-turkey day, it couldn’t hurt to add a little leftover stuffing in each of your holes before adding the eggs on top.
